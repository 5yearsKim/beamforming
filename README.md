# beamforming
implementing beamforming algorithm for simulation 

# describtion
beamforming is generally used to calculate direction/position of the source of audio signal
finding the most appropriate number of sensors and distance between sensors through simulation is our goal

the algorithm has 4 steps 
1. generating pseudo signal from different angle and position
2. sensors receive signal and calculate direction of source using beamforming algorithm
3. compare the accuracy of algorithm depending on number of sensors and distance between sensors

# implementation

make;
./run


# usage
change parameter through "PARAM.h". every beamform class's parameter is initialize with that values.
